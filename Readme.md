# Language Detection App

## Overview

The Language Detection App is a web application built using Streamlit, a popular framework for creating interactive web apps in Python. The app utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to detect the language of input text. It supports both single text detection and batch processing, with customizable confidence thresholds and interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **Single Text Detection**: Detects the language of a single input text with options for automatic language detection or specified language.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple texts at once and provides language detection results for each text.
- **Confidence Threshold**: Allows users to set a minimum confidence level for language detection results.
- **Language Distribution Visualization**: Displays a bar chart of detected language frequencies in batch results.
- **Word Cloud Visualization**: Generates a word cloud from the input texts for visual representation.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and display appropriate error messages.
